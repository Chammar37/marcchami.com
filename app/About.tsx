                    <p> 
                    My unique background blending the discipline of martial arts with creativity of music, has shaped my approach to overcoming challenges.
                    As a 2nd-degree black belt, and pianist trained by the Royal Conservatory of Music, I&apos;ve learned the value of hard work, resilience and pursuit of excellence.
                    These principles guided me through my Computer Science BS.c, achieved with Honors. 
                    I always desire to be the dumbest in the room, hoping to learn from others.
