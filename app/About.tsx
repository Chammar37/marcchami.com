                <p className="mr-3/20"> I am committed to making a positive change in the world during my lifetime, and I believe that starts with staying persistent and immersing myself in a working environment with smart minds will help me accomplish my aspirations.</p> <br></br>
                <p className="mr-3/20"> My background in martial arts, where I achieved a 2nd-degree black belt, and my teacher-level piano skills acquired through the Royal Conservatory of Music, have instilled in me a strong work ethic, discipline, and gratitude for every opportunity. And I desire to be the dumbest in the room, always looking to learn from others! My Moto: Nobody can tell me how to think, but everyone has a lesson to teach me - Lex Friedman</p>
