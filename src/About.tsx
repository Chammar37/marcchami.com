                    My experience blending multiple disciplines from martial arts to music best describes my personality and how I approach challenges.
                    As a 2nd-degree black belt, and pianist trained by the Royal Conservatory of Music, I&apos;ve learned the value of hard work, resilience and pursuit of excellence.
                    The principles I&apos;ve learned studying these practices for 15+ years had guided me through my Computer Science BS.c degree, achieved with Honors.
                    <p>
                    I always approach challenges and collaboration with humility, hoping to learn from others.
